A star tracker based on [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).

This repository contains a bare upload of an old project of mine that might undertake a full rework in the future.

The code here present is related to an implementation of a double-arm [Barn Door Tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_door_tracker).
